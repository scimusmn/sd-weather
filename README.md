# Simple weather application for San Diego

## Setup

### Define application settings
    $ cd meteor/settings
    $ cp settings.default.json settings.json

Edit the settings.json file, defining your Forecast.io API key and how often
you'd like to update the data. Set the frequency using natural language,
based on [a later.js pattern](http://bunkat.github.io/later/parsers.html#text).

### Start Meteor

    $ meteor --settings settings.json --port 4000
